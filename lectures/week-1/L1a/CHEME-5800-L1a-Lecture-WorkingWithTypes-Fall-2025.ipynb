    "# L1a: Introduction to Data Types\n",
    "In this lecture, we are going to talk about types. All data in a computer program has a **type**, which is part of a type system that classifies data and constrains operations. Besides (sort of) standardizing how things are stored, type systems enable detection of mismatches (e.g., passing a string where a number is expected) before or during execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type System Approaches:**\n",
    "* **Modern languages** (e.g., [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) or [Python](https://www.python.org/)) have dynamic type systems that perform checks at runtime, offering flexibility but deferring error detection.\n",
    "* **Classical languages** (e.g., [C](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or [Java](https://www.java.com/en/)) use static type systems that require explicit declarations and perform checks at compile-time, enabling optimization and early error prevention.\n",
    "* **Julia's hybrid approach** combines the best of both worlds: it's dynamically typed like Python but performs type inference and generates specialized machine code like C. While dynamically typed at the language level, Julia compiles to optimized, statically-typed machine code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we'll cover:** We'll explore primitive types (numbers, text), collection types (arrays, tuples, sets and dictionaries), and custom composite types, examining their memory representation and manipulation in Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Logistics\n",
    "Before we get to the type system, let’s review the course policy, procedures, and expectations. Links are posted on Canvas: the course policy and procedures are available [here](https://cornell.box.com/s/y1mxxj9fvbdvuz9gpjcdzkqkfks1dxlh), and the course schedule is available [here](https://cornell.box.com/s/wk8pjbdnjodtppfuksuy3zlxsb8k7rpn).

Each character, whether a letter, digit, punctuation mark, or control code, gets stored as an integer corresponding to a specific encoding scheme. Traditional systems used [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) with one byte per character, while modern systems use [Unicode encodings like UTF-8 or UTF-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) to represent a much wider range of characters.\n",

However, if any element is a non-isbits type (like a String), the tuple's fields become [pointers to heap-allocated objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)), each aligned and stored sequentially.\n",
