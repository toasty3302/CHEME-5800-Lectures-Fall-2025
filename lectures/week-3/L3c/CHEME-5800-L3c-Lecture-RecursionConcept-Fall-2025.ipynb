    "# Recursion: Conceptual Overview\n",
    "Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself with a modified version of its input. Why use recursion? The key idea of recursion is to break a problem down into smaller, more manageable subproblems. Each recursive call works on a smaller piece of the original problem until it reaches the base case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _body_ of a recursive function has two parts:\n",
    "* __Base case:__ This is the condition that stops the recursion. When the function reaches the base case, it returns a result without calling itself again. This is necessary to prevent the function from entering an infinite loop.\n",
    "* __Recursive case:__ This is part of the function that calls itself with a modified version of its input. The recursive case is responsible for breaking the problem into smaller subproblems and solving them using the function.\n",
