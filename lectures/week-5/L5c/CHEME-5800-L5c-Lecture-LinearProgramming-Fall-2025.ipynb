    "# Linear Programming and Resource Allocation\n",

    "* __Primal and Dual Linear Programming__: In the _primal problem_, we directly choose how much of an activity (e.g. production levels) to do in to optimize a cost, profit, satisfaction while respecting resource limits. In the _dual problem_, you instead assign a _shadow price_ to each resource constraint—choosing those prices so that, if every activity were valued at its resource cost, the total value of your resources is maximized or minimized.\n",
    "* __Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) Conditions__: The KKT conditions for a linear program say, intuitively, that at the optimum you must satisfy all your original constraints, assign _shadow prices_ that respect the cost structure, and have any slack in a constraint paired with a zero price (and vice versa). We care about these because they give a foolproof certificate of optimality and directly drive the pivot rules in simplex and the search directions in interior-point methods.\n",

    "## Primal Linear Programming Problems\n",
    "Suppose you have a _linear_ objective function $O:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ of the continuous decision variable vector $\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ whose values are constrained by a system of $m$ linear equations.

    "There are several key differences between the primal and dual linear programming problems:\n",
    "1. The objective function flips (maximum ⇒ minimum or minimum ⇒ maximum).  \n",
    "2. Primal objective coefficients $c_i$ become the dual right-hand side constants.  \n",
    "3. Primal right-hand side constants $b_j$ become the dual objective coefficients.  \n",
    "4. The $m\\times n$ constraint matrix $A$ is transposed in the dual (so $A^\\top$ appears).  \n",
    "5. The number of variables and constraints swap:  the primal has $n$ variables, $m$ constraints, and the dual has $m$ variables and $n$ constraints.\n",
    "6. Each primal constraint $a_j^\\top x \\le b_j$ gives a dual variable $y_j$.  Each primal variable $x_i$ gives a dual constraint $(A^\\top y)_i \\ge c_i$.  \n",
    "7. Inequality directions and sign restrictions invert for the constraints: A $\\le$ constraint in the primal gives rise to a $\\ge$ constraint in the dual (and vice versa).   \n",
    "8. Equality constraints in the primal become free variables in the dual, i.e., $a_j^T x \\;\\;=\\; b_j$ gives rise to a dual variable $y_j$ that is free (no sign restriction), while a dual constraint $A^\\top y \\;\\;\\ge\\; c$ gives rise to a primal variable $x_i$ that is free.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the solutions of the primal and dual problems are related by the concept of __duality__. For a primal problem:  $\\max\\{\\,c^T x : A x \\le b,\\;x\\ge0\\}$  and its corresponding dual problem :$\\min\\{\\,b^T y : A^T y \\ge c,\\;y\\ge0\\}$ the solutions are related:\n",
    "* __Weak duality__:  For any primal feasible $x$ and dual feasible $y$, we have $c^T x \\le b^T y$. Thus, the primal optimum is always bounded above by the dual optimum. The difference between the two is called the _duality gap_.\n",
    "* __Strong duality__:  If both primal and dual are feasible and have finite optimal values, then $\\max\\{\\,c^T x \\} = \\min\\{\\,b^T y\\}$, i.e., the _duality gap is zero_. This means that the optimal values of the primal and dual problems are equal.\n",
