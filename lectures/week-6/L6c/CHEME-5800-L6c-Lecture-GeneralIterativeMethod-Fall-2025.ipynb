    "# Iterative Method for Solving Linear Algebraic Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we consider specific methods to solve systems of linear algebraic equations, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Jacobi Method__: The Jacobi method is an iterative solver that, starting from an initial guess, repeatedly refines each unknown in parallel using the residual between the right-hand side and the contributions of the other variables. It’s easy to implement and parallelize, and converges when the system matrix satisfies appropriate conditions (e.g., strict diagonal dominance).\n",
    "* __Gauss–Seidel Method__: The Gauss–Seidel method is an iterative solver that, starting from an initial guess, refines each unknown one at a time using the most recent updates, feeding back new values immediately. This change typically yields faster convergence than Jacobi under the same matrix conditions. It’s simple to implement but inherently sequential, and converges when the system matrix is, for example, strictly diagonally dominant.\n",
    "* __Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) Method__: The SOR method builds on Gauss–Seidel by introducing a relaxation factor $\\omega\\in(0,2)$ that _over-relaxes_ each update, i.e., it blends the new Gauss–Seidel value with the old iterate to accelerate convergence further. With a well-chosen $\\omega$, SOR can dramatically speed up solving diagonally-dominant systems, with convergence guaranteed for $0<\\omega<2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's step back and sketch out a general method, then we'll discuss each specific method in different lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General\n",
    "Suppose we have a _square system_ of linear equations represented in matrix form as $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$,\n",
    "where the system matrix $\\mathbf{A}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$, the unknown vector is $\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and $\\mathbf{b}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the right-hand side vector. Our goal is to _iteratively_ find a vector $\\mathbf{x}$ that _satisfies (in some sense)_ this equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's sketch the steps of a general iterative method for solving this linear system.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Initialize__: Given the system matrix $\\mathbf{A}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ and the right-hand side vector $\\mathbf{b}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, we start with an initial guess for the solution vector $\\mathbf{x}^{(0)}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. This guess can be a zero vector or any other reasonable approximation. Set $\\texttt{converged} \\gets \\texttt{false}$ and the iteration counter $k\\gets0$. Specify a convergence criterion, such as a tolerance level $\\epsilon > 0$, and a maximum number of iterations $\\texttt{max\\_iter}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "While not $\\texttt{converged}$ __do__:\n",
    "1. Calculate the residual vector $\\mathbf{r}^{(k)} \\gets \\mathbf{b} - \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}^{(k)}$.\n",
    "2. Check for convergence:\n",
    "   - If $\\|\\mathbf{r}^{(k)}\\|_{2} < \\epsilon$, __then__: set $\\texttt{converged} \\gets \\texttt{true}$. \n",
    "   - If $k \\geq \\texttt{max\\_iter}$, __then__: set $\\texttt{converged} \\gets \\texttt{true}$, and print a __warning__ that the method did not converge.\n",
    "3. Calculate an update direction. Split $\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{M} - \\mathbf{N}$, where $\\mathbf{M}$ is a matrix that can be easily inverted (e.g., diagonal or triangular), and $\\mathbf{N}$ is the remaining part of the matrix. The update direction can then be computed as: $\\mathbf{d}^{(k)} \\gets \\mathbf{M}^{-1}\\mathbf{r}^{(k)}$.\n",
    "4. Update the solution vector: $\\mathbf{x}^{(k+1)} \\gets \\mathbf{x}^{(k)} + \\mathbf{d}^{(k)}$.\n",
    "5. Increment the iteration counter: $k \\gets k + 1$.\n",
