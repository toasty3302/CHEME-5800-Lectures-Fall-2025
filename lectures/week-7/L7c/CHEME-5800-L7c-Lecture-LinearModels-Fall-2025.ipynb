    "* __Linear regression__ is a statistical method for modeling the relationship between a target variable (output) and one or more features (input) by fitting a linear model to observed data. It provides a straightforward method for predicting outcomes and understanding the relationships between variables. The model is linear in the parameters, not necessarily in the features.\n",
    "* __Continuous variable prediction tasks__: In machine learning, linear regression models are commonly employed for continuous variable prediction tasks. These models enable the estimation of numerical outcomes based on the (non)linear relationships identified between input features and the target variable.\n",
    "* __Binary classification tasks__: While linear regression is primarily designed for continuous outcomes, it can be adapted to binary classification by applying an output function (e.g., the sign function or logistic transformation). We will introduce the Perceptron, learn how to evaluate its performance using a confusion matrix, and then motivate logistic regression as an alternative approach.\n",

    "## Confusion Matrix for Binary Classification\n",
    "A **confusion matrix** is a table used to evaluate the performance of a binary classification model. It compares the predicted class labels to the true class labels, providing a detailed breakdown of correct and incorrect predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The confusion matrix for a binary classifier is typically structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "|                     | **Predicted Positive** | **Predicted Negative** |\n",
    "|---------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n",
    "| **Actual Positive** | True Positive (TP)     | False Negative (FN)    |\n",
    "| **Actual Negative** | False Positive (FP)    | True Negative (TN)     |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Each Quadrant\n",
    "- **True Positive (TP):** The model correctly predicts positive when the actual class is positive. Example: correctly diagnosing a patient who actually has a disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **False Positive (FP):** The model incorrectly predicts positive when the actual class is negative. This is a \"false alarm\"—like telling a healthy patient they have a disease when they don't.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **False Negative (FN):** The model incorrectly predicts negative when the actual class is positive. This means missing a true case—like failing to diagnose a patient who actually has the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **True Negative (TN):** The model correctly predicts negative when the actual class is negative. Example: correctly identifying that a healthy patient is indeed healthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is the Confusion Matrix Important?\n",
    "The confusion matrix provides a comprehensive view of classifier performance and enables calculation of key metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Accuracy**: $\\frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}$ — overall correctness\n",
    "* **Precision**: $\\frac{TP}{TP + FP}$ — of all positive predictions, how many were correct?\n",
    "* **Recall (Sensitivity)**: $\\frac{TP}{TP + FN}$ — of all actual positives, how many were correctly identified?\n",
    "* **Specificity**: $\\frac{TN}{TN + FP}$ — of all actual negatives, how many were correctly identified?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key Insight**: Different applications require different trade-offs. In medical diagnosis, high recall (avoiding false negatives) might be more important than high precision, as missing a disease can be more costly than a false alarm.\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing each quadrant, you can understand the types of errors your model makes and make informed decisions about model improvements, threshold adjustments, or cost-sensitive learning approaches.\n",
