    "# Introduction to Control Flow, Iteration and Functions\n",
    "In this module, we explore ideas in control flow and iteration, focusing on how to structure programs to make decisions and repeat actions.\n",

    "By the end of this module, you will be able to define and demonstrate mastery of the following key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Conditional Statements:__ Conditional statements that execute different code blocks based on whether a condition is `true` or `false`, allowing for branching logic in programs.\n",
    "* __Iteration:__ Iterative constructs that repeat a block of code. If the number of iterations is known beforehand, a __for loop__ is used; if the number of iterations is not predetermined, a __while loop__ is employed.\n",

    "## Conditional statements\n",
    "Conditional statements are constructs that allow a program to execute different code blocks based on whether a specified condition is true or false. They enable branching logic, making programs more dynamic and responsive to different inputs or states.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Scenario__: Suppose you want to execute a block of code, for example, to write model simulation results to a file. We want this block to execute only if a certain condition is met, such as the model converging, otherwise we want the simulation to continue. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a diagram for `if-else` statements:\n",

    "    </center>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use an `if-else` statement to control whether that block of code runs. If the condition is `true`, the code runs; if `false`, something else happens (or nothing at all). \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, there are many variations of this idea. For example, you can have an `if` statement with multiple `else if` clauses that check another condition if the first one is false, ending with an `else` clause that runs if none of the previous conditions are true.\n",

    "\n",
    "These control flow paradigms are conserved across many programming languages; if you understand how they work in one language, you can easily adapt to others. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in Python, the syntax for an `if-else` statement looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # Code to execute if the condition is true\n",

    "else:\n",
    "    # Code to execute if condition and another_condition are false\n",
    "```\n",

    "* Clear and informative documentation is essential for fostering efficient and effective communication between developers and users. A well-defined function must have clear input and output specifications, making it easy to understand.\n",
    "* Function naming is critical because it clearly and accurately communicates the purpose and behavior of the function.\n",

    "Finally, good variable names make your code readable, allowing other developers (and even yourself in the future) to understand what the variable or constant represents simply by reading its name."

    "We covered the basics of functions, but there is much more to learn about defining and using functions, which we'll cover in the examples of this module. Let's do a preview of a few of these features:\n",
    "* __Arguments__: There are a _bunch_ of ways we can pass data into functions, i.e., different argument passing techniques that we'll explore in the examples of this module. We only showed you the most basic way to pass arguments into a function, i.e., positional arguments. Just wait, your mind will be blown by some of the cool things we can do!\n",
    "* __Error handling:__ Functions can raise errors when something goes wrong, and we can handle these errors gracefully to prevent our program from crashing. We'll explore this concept in the examples of this module.\n",
    "* __Scope:__ Functions can create local variables that are not accessible outside the function. What happens inside a function stays inside the function! However, we'll see special functions called _mutating functions_ that can modify global variables, i.e., variables defined outside the function. This is a powerful feature, but it can also lead to unexpected behavior if not used carefully.\n",
